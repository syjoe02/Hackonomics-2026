        USER'S CALENDAR EVENTS:
        {events_text}

        NEWS ARTICLE / DOCUMENT:
        {document_text}

        TASK:
        1. Identify EVERY event in the list above that could be impacted by the news.
        2. If multiple events share the same impact (e.g., 'Oil Price Increase' affects all driving-related events), you MUST group all their IDs together.
        3. Return a JSON array where each item follows this format exactly:

        [
        {{
            "title": "<Short Impact Summary>",
            "description": "<Why this matters for these specific events>",
            "event_ids": ["ID1", "ID2", "ID3"],
            "priority": "HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW"
        }}
        ]

        CRITICAL RULES:
        - DO NOT be lazy. If 5 events are related, include all 5 IDs in the "event_ids" array.
        - If no events are related, return an empty array [].
